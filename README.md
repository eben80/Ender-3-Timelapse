# Ender-3-Timelapse
Cura post-processing script for custom mechanical timelapse trigger.
Settings for display position, trigger position, retraction, pause time, and z hop.
Allows you to specify Z hop to prevent the extruder from hitting the print.
Fast moves to help prevent artifacts and stringing resulting from trigger moves and premature extrusion.

Note: This script is not exclusively for the Ender 3 but the values are pre-configured for it.
You can use this script with other printers and Cura provided that you customize the display and trigger settings for your set-up.
You need to determine those settings and use them.


Installation: Copy .py file into the Cura scripts folder and restart Cura.

Based on Custom Timelapse of Wayne Porter
